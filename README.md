## Introduction

The Book Discovery App is a simple React-based application that displays a collection of books. Each book has a title, author, image, and a brief description. When a user hovers over a book or clicks "Learn More," they can explore more about the book in a modal with additional details. This app uses Tailwind CSS for styling and smooth animations.

- **Book Grid**: Displays books in a responsive grid layout.
- **Hover Effect**: Hover over a book to see a quick preview.
- **Modal View**: Click "Learn More" to open a larger modal with the book's image and description.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Experience zoom-in and fade-in animations for a polished UI.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for easy and responsive styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript for interactivity and logic.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and lifecycle methods.
